## ANN-repository

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and resources focused on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), covering core concepts, practical implementations, and common challenges. This repository is ideal for beginners and enthusiasts looking to understand and experiment with ANNs from scratch.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Manual backpropagation without Keras
- Dropout for regularization
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Feature scaling techniques
- The vanishing gradient problem
- Perceptron algorithms and related issues

**What's Inside:**
- Step-by-step code examples and explanations
- Demonstrations of common ANN problems and solutions
- Notebooks for hands-on experimentation

**Coming Soon:**
More notebooks and guides on advanced ANN topics, architectures, and real-world applications.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Explore, run, and modify the code to deepen your understanding.
